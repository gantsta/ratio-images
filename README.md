A simple recipe for making images preserve their aspect ratio using CSS

The LESS code shown is hopefully self-explanatory. The magic formula is the padding-top value on the container div. To get your percentage value simply divide the sum of your aspect ratio (EG 6 / 4) by 100. 6 / 4 equals 1.5 so, our equation is 100 / 1.5 which equals 66.6666666.
